populator that removes default trees!

Seperate length and radius termination and decay (fence sapling)
Per iteration gene and alterations
More accurate leaf radius ect
Genome on Website:
- direct inputs
- upload inputs to continue edits
- presets of all in game trees
- expand and contract sections
- loading animation ...
- Root functions (poly not exponential?)
- Buttons instead of rotation (NE LK < >)
Check if tree has space above equal to trunk
Improved growth, more time options
tpop web app
Leaf/fence decay
[Tri, pine, space pop, en, cacti, palm]
async post build calc
plane translation takes vector instead of plane?


*curve functions instead of just straight lines
* fib

Tree types [pine, cactus, palm, mangrove (w/ jungel wood + special sapling placement listeners to keep it placed), jungle, end, underwater]

* web based tpop creator (grids with textures to show biomes and sized dots to show about how many trees and space will be taken up)

* multiple tree spawner of same species (store as 1 2 3 instead of species)
* message on close after editing ("updated") and "generator updated";
